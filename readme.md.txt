# 🎮 Hangman Word Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line Hangman game developed using Python as part of the
CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.
This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops,
conditionals, sets, and user input handling.

## 🚀 Features
- Random word selection
- Prevents duplicate guesses
- Input validation
- Case-insensitive input
- Simple and user-friendly gameplay

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Download or clone the repository
3. Run the file using:

## 🎯 Design Note (Intentional Behavior)
- The word list is fixed and predefined.
- For the word **"good"**, repeated letters are revealed one position at a time.
- This behavior is intentional and designed to make the game slightly more challenging,
requiring the player to think carefully rather than gaining full information from a single guess.
- This design choice introduces a tricky gameplay element within a limited and controlled scope.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding loops and conditional logic
- Using sets to track game state
- Handling user input safely
- Implementing basic game logic in Python
